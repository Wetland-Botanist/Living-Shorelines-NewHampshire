RPI_CoreGroups_BootStrap CSV files Explainer/Metadata:

- RPI scores for individual metrics were calculated in R code (LivingShorelines_Boostrap_R code)

- RPI scores for individual core groups (Vegetation, Pore water, and Nekton) were calculated in Microsoft Excel and compiled into CSV format

Columns:

Weighted: Core group RPI score weighted by the number of core groups with ranges of 0 - 0.5 with 2 core groups, 0 - 0.33 with 3 core groups

Unweighted: Core group RPI scores without weighting by the number of core groups with ranges of 0 - 1.0

NoNekton: To provide clarity on the impact of inclusion of Nekton in 2020 - 2022, the weighted scores of each core group were re-calculated with ranges of 0 - 0.5

PW_Corrected_Nekton: Core group RPI scores weighted by the number of core groups (see 'Weighted' column) with adjustments to the pore water RPI scores. The adjustments were as follows: Redox potential was manually assigned a score of zero for Cutts Cove 2021 and North Mill Pond 2019 and 2020. 

PW_Corrected_Nekton: Core group RPI scores unweighted by the number of core groups with the adjustments to the pore water RPI scores.

Please note - PW_Corrected columns were used for reporting the final RPI scores in manuscript.
